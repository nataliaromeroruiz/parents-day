    Dear Dad,
  </p>
  <p class="text-success"p>
I know you to be warm-hearted and caring, loving and nurturing. I know you to be soft and thoughtful. I know you to be a philosopher of sorts, a writer, an intellectual, a critic and a thinker of deep thoughts. I know you to be a speaker, a lighter of rooms and a challenger of nonsense. I know you to be mysterious, foreign, and a holder of sacred thoughts. I know you to be all of these things and more, even if no one else can see it.
  </p>
  <p class="text-primary">
    With as much love as the world can contain,
    Your Daughter
  </p>
